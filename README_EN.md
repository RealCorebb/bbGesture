## Gesture Sensor That Works Through Objects

I have previously created embedded projects with gesture interaction support, but most optical gesture sensors on the market need to be exposed, affecting aesthetics. Now, I have developed a gesture sensor that can detect hands and recognize gestures through objects, even supporting 3D positioning.
